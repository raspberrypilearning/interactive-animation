## How to ...

In order to support your making during this project you can use the **How to ...** dropdowns if and when you need to. 

In this project there are three **How to ...**. Each covers a different aspect of Scratch:

+ Set-up: Project, backdrop and sprite 
+ Sprite movement
+ Graphic effects

A **How to ...** looks like the below. Hover over the grey bar and, when it turns yellow, click the down arrow on the right-hand side to access the information in the **How to ...**.

Use a **How to ...** only when you need to. Some tasks suggest what topic you should search for in a **How to ...**. 

Search a **How to ...** using 'âŒ˜F' (the 'command' and 'F' keys at the same  time). For instance, search now for the word 'command' in this ingredient. You will see it highlights whenever  the word is used in the **How to ...**.
