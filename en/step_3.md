## How to ...

In order to support your making during this project you can use the **How to ...** dropdowns if and when you need to. 

In this project there are three **How to ...**. Each covers a different aspect of Scratch:

+ access the Scratch interface
+ set-up project, backdrop and sprite 
+ create sprite movement
+ create graphic effects
+ design with the Paint editor
+ share Scratch projects

A **How to ...** looks like the below. Hover over the grey bar and, when it turns yellow, click the down arrow on the right-hand side to access the information in the **How to ...**.
