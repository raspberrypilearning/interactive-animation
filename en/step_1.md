## Introduction
You're going to create a project to try and change someone's mood using sprites that move over a backdrop. You will choose a theme for your project such as relaxing, energising, funny, inspiring or something else - it's your choice.

## Skills you should have
To complete this Make a difference project you need to have the following skills which you will have learnt when completing the first two projects in the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself) pathway.

[Stress ball](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/stress-ball){:target="_blank"}:
+ How to add code to sprites and a backdrop
+ How to use the tools in the Paint editor to add details to a sprite
+ How to add `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"} and `sound`{:class="block3sound"} to a sprite

[Butterfly garden](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/butterfly-garden){:target="_blank"}:
+ How to use `motion`{:class="block3motion"} blocks to create animation
+ How to use costumes to customise sprites
+ How to use the `forever`{:class="block3control"} block

You will now apply these skills to create your own project where you will choose your own sprites and backdrop to create a unique interactive animation.

## What you will make
In this example project, the balloons move around the screen in different ways using loops. When the user clicks on the balloons, the balloons pop and dissappear.
