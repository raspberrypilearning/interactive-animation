## Add more sprites
Now you've got one sprite moving the way you want it to, add another sprite to make your animation more dynamic.

--- task ---

**Investigate** the example projects where the sprite movement seems relevant to your ideas. 

**Tip**: Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.

Now compare sprites and/or projects code. Explore the **Code** tab of each sprite. Each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes its behaviour unique:

+ `events`{:class="block3events"} blocks - two of the projects use more than one way to create **user interaction**.

+ `motion`{:class="block3motion"} blocks - **compare** the code used to create the movement for each sprite.

+ explore how various `looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks are used to alter the size and **appearance** of a sprite.

Investigate the **Costumes** tab:
+  some projects use more than one **costume** to make the animation more interesting or realistic. 



--- task ---

Ask yourself the following questions about the second sprite:
+ If your first sprite came with a series of costumes, do you want to make your second sprite's costumes?
+ What position will it start from?
+ Does it need to be a different colour?
+ How big should it be? 
+ Which direction should it point in?
+ How will it move differently to the first sprite?
+ Will it appear behind or in front or other sprites?

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You now need to create a second sprite. Choose one of these methods:
+ Duplicate your first sprite if you want multiples of the same sprite
+ create a new sprite and copy over the first sprite's code 
+ create a new sprite and start coding it from the beginning

--- collapse ---

title: Duplicate a sprite

---

Right click on your first sprite in the Sprite list below the Stage (or if you are using a tablet, tap and hold):
![Image right click first sprite](images/challenge1-right-click-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Select 'duplicate'. This will create a copy of your first 1 sprite with the suffix '2':
![Image duplicate sprite](images/challenge1-duplicate-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Rename your sprite:
![Image rename sprite](images/challenge1-rename-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Your sprite's name will change in the Sprite list:
![Image change name in list](images/challenge1-sprite-list.png){:width="300px"}

Your second sprite has exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have begun to alter the second sprite - you will not see the second sprite because it is sitting underneath the first sprite.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---

title: Copy sprite code

---
In the Sprite menu, go to **Choose a Sprite** and select your second sprite.

Click the first sprite and go to its **Code** tab. Drag the code that is in the first sprite to the second sprite. You may have one script that starts with `when the green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} as well as another script that starts with `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. Make sure you copy **all** the code scripts that you have created.

--- task ---

Selected the second sprite in the Sprite list and click on its **Code** tab. Now edit the code so that the new sprite does what you want it to do. 

Alter the second sprite's position, colour or size. 

--- collapse ---
---

title: Position

---

Within the Stage, use the mouse or touch-screen to drag your second sprite to the position you want it to start at the beginning of the animation. The second sprite will go to this position `when the green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

Alternatively, use the `motion`{:class="block3motion"} block `go to x: () y: ()`{:class="block3motion"} as part of your set-up code so that the sprite will always start in the x and y position that you set.

--- collapse ---

title: Colour

---

Change the colour of your sprite. Click on the second sprite in the Sprite menu. Then select its **Costumes** tab.

Use the **arrow tool** to highlight whichever part of the costume you want to change colour.

![Image showing arrow tool in Paint editor](images/challenge1-arrow-tool.png){:width="300px"}

![Image showing arrow tool selecting shape](images/challenge1-arrow-tool-selecting-shape.png){:width="300px"}

Go to the **Fill tool** and select the colour. It will automatically fill the shape that you have selected.

![Image showing Fill tool in Paint editor](images/challenge1-fill-tool.png){:width="300px"}

Repeat the steps above with any part of the costume you have missed or for any other part of the costume you want to change the colour of.

For a reminder on **How to...** change the second sprite's size go to the earlier step 'Change your sprite's looks'.

Do you need to delete blocks of code?

--- collapse ---
---

title: Deleting code

---

You can delete blocks of code in a number of ways:
+ Drag individual blocks away from the main script, leaving the blocks with in the Code window. 
+ Delete the blocks of code for good by dragging them towards the Blocks menu.
+ Select the block you want to delete and right-click witth the mouse. Select the 'delete block' option.

**Tip**: in programming, there is often more than one way to do something.

Go back to the **How to...** on the earlier step 'Make a sprite bounce' for `point in direction`{:class="block3motion"} and `set rotation style`{:class="block3motion"}.

Change where your second sprite sits in relation to the first sprite. Layering sprites helps them appear to sit 3-dimensionally within the backdrop.

title: Layers

--- /task ---

You may want to tweak the position, size, layers etc of your second sprite. It may take a few attempts before you are pleased with your second sprite's movement.

--- task ---

If you have time, keep adding more sprites. Make each one a little different to the others.
