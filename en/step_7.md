## Do something when clicked

Now you're going to make your sprite do something `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. Your sprite could play a `sound`{:class="block3sound"}, `move`{:class="block3motion"},  or change the way it `looks`{:class="block3looks"} or any combination. It's up to you.

Decide what you want your sprite to do when the user clicks or taps on it. Choose an action that makes sense for your sprite. 

This chick chirps and jumps backwards when you click on it:

Add code to make your sprite do something when it is clicked. You can pick one of these examples as a starting point.

title: Click to make sound and motion

You can make your sprite perform an action such as playing a sound or moving when you click on it, and you can combine blocks to create a sequence of actions for the sprite to do every time you click on it. 

**Chirp and jump back when clicked** - <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/435649420/editor/" target="_blank" style="background-color: #4d97ff; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 1rem; border-radius:.25rem; text-decoration:none;">See Inside</a>

</div>

Add code blocks under a `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} to run them when the sprite is clicked. This example plays a sound and move the sprite backwards. It can be used with a moving sprite. 

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
play sound [chirp v] until done
move (-50) steps
```

title: Click to change and then change back

---

You can add actions that make a change to a sprite and then reverse them such as growing, waiting and then shrinking. 

**Squash ball when clicked** - <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/435723273/editor/" target="_blank" style="background-color: #4d97ff; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 1rem; border-radius:.25rem; text-decoration:none;">See Inside</a>

</div>

This code will grow a sprite and apply the fisheye effect for one second and then return to normal:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set size to (110)
set [fisheye v] effect to (50)
wait (0.5) seconds
set [fisheye v] effect to (0)
set size to (100)
```

title: Click to make a change, reset with green flag

---
You can make your sprite change when you click on it and then reset it when the green flag is clicked. 

**Balloon pop when clicked** - <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/435725465/editor/" target="_blank" style="background-color: #4d97ff; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 1rem; border-radius:.25rem; text-decoration:none;">See Inside</a>
<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/435725465/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

This code makes a balloon 'pop' using `sound`{:class="block3sound"} and `looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks. 

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
change size by (10)
change [brightness v] effect by (25)
wait (0.1) seconds
play sound [pop v] until done
set [ghost v] effect to (100)
```

You need to make sure you also have set up code so that your balloon is not popped when you start your project:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set size to (100)
clear graphic effects
```

Keep changing and testing your code until you are happy with the way your sprite reacts when you click on it.
