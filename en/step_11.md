## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Applied your skills to realise your own project ideas to create an interactive animation
+ Selected appropriate blocks for your plan
+ Thought about what you've made and the ways you can improve it

If you are following the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/look-after-yourself) pathway and have not completed the last three projects — Fruit salad, Relax and stretch, and Focus on the prize — then now continue the pathway with [Fruit salad](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/fruit-salad).

If you have completed all the projects in the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself) pathway, then move on to the next challenge project, [Project name](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/project-name) project. In this project, you will make another interactive animation using variables.
