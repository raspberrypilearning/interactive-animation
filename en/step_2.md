## Get inspiration

You are going to create a Make a difference project to change someone's mood. The theme of the project, how it looks and the way the sprites move is up to you. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

--- task ---

Click the green flag on each project to see the code run.

Give some thought to **your** projects theme, how it will look and the way you want **your** sprites to move.

--- print-only ---

Have a look at the [Make a difference](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27520550){:target="_blank"} example projects from the Raspberry Pi Foundation Scratch studio or explore some projects which are given below.

Click on the green flags below to **experience** the following example Scratch projects. Look at the appearance of each sprite and how they move:

**Popping balloons**:
<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/435808726/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

**Animal behaviour**:
<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/433177517/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

**Bouncing balls**:
<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/425675232/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Now **Investigate** the projects where the sprite movement seems relevant to your ideas:

**Popping balloons** - click [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/435808726/editor){:target="_blank"} to `see inside`{:class="block3motion"}

**Animal behaviour**  - click
[![See inside icon](images/see_inside.png)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/433177517/editor/){:target="_blank"}

[Bouncing balls]  - click
[![See inside icon](images/see_inside.png)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/425675232){:target="_blank"}

**Tip:** Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.

Investigate the **Code** tab  of each sprite. Each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes its behaviour unique:

+ `events`{:class="block3events"} blocks - some sprites use more than method of **user interaction**.

+ `motion`{:class="block3motion"} blocks - **compare** the code used to create the movement for each sprite.

+ explore how various `looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks are used to alter the size and **appearance** of a sprite.

Investigate the **Costumes** tab:
+  some projects use more than one **costume** to make the animation more interesting or realistic.
