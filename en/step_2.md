## Get inspiration

You are going to create a Make a difference project to change someone's mood. The theme of the project, how it looks and the way the sprites move is up to you. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.



--- task ---

Have a look at the [Make a difference](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27520550){:target="_blank"} example projects from the Raspberry Pi Foundation Scratch studio or explore the same projects which are given below.

Click the green flag on each project to see the code run.

Each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes each sprite's movement unique.

Give some thought to **your** projects theme, how it will look and the way you want **your** sprites to move.
