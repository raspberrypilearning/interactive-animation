## Get inspiration

You are going to create a Make a difference project to change someone's mood. The theme of the project, how it looks and the way the sprites move is up to you. 

You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

Have a look at the [Make a difference](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27520550){:target="_blank"} example projects from the Raspberry Pi Foundation Scratch studio or explore the same projects which are given below.

Click the green flag on each project to see the code run.

Give some thought to **your** projects theme, how it will look and the way you want **your** sprites to move.

Investigate the **Popping balloons** Scratch project.

**Tip:** Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.

Compare the code used in each sprite in projects as each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes its movement unique. To do this, click on each sprite's **Code** tab.
