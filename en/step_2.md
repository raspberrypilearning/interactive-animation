You can get ideas for your own project by investigating projects created by others.

Click the green flags below to **experience** the example Scratch projects. Look at the appearance of each sprite and how they move. Can you identify the projects where the sprites are interactive?

Give some thought to **your** project's theme, how it will look, and the way you want **your** sprites to move:
