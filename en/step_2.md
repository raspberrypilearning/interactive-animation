## Get inspiration

You are going to create a Make a difference project to change someone's mood. The theme of the project, how it looks and the way the sprites move is up to you. 

--- task ---

You can get ideas for your own Make a difference project by investigating projects created by others.

Don't worry about the code and **how** things will work just yet. Instead, as you look at the projects below, give some thought to **your** projects theme, how it will look and the way you want **your** sprites to move.

Have a look at the [Make a difference](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27520550){:target="_blank"} from the Raspberry Pi Foundation Scratch studio listed below.

Click the green flag on a project to see the code run.

Click `See inside`{:class="block3motion"} below a project to investigate its code. Each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes each sprite's movement unique.

**Tip:** Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.
