## Animate using motion

Now it's time to get your first sprite moving. Start with one sprite and then add more. 

Each sprite will `move`{:class="block3motion"} within a <span class="keyword">`forever`{:class="block3control"} block<span class="definition">Runs the code blocks inside it forever, or until you click the red stop button above the Stage.</span></span> so that it keeps moving.

Think about how you want **your** sprite to move. For example, you might say "I want my sprite to move up and down the stage really slowly," or "I want my sprite to move quickly in a diagonal line."

Add code to make your sprite bounce and/or spin around the Stage in the way you want it to. 

If you need a reminder about how to create your sprite's movement when it bounces on the edge of the Stage then click the below **How to...**.

This code makes a sprite bounce on the left-hand and right-hand edges of the Stage. Because the sprite rotates horizontally it appears to flip when changing its direction `when flag  clicked`{:class="block3events"} is clicked:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (90)
set rotation style [left-right v]
forever
move (5) steps
if on edge, bounce
```

The `point in direction`{:class="block3motion"} block automatically points your sprite to the right (`90` degrees) when the `green flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}. If you change the number of degrees to `-90` your sprite will point left.

Add a `set rotation  style`{:class="block3motion"} block and select the drop-down `left-right`{:class="block3motion"} so your sprite won't flip upside down when it bounces off the edge of the Stage.  

**Tip:** You can drag your sprite on the Stage to move it to the y (up-down) position that you want.

This code makes a sprite bounce up and down the Stage when the green flag is clicked:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
set rotation style [don't rotate v]
forever
move (5) steps
if on edge, bounce
```

Change the number of degrees in `point in direction`{:class="block3motion"} block to `0` to make a sprite point upwards when the green flag is clicked.

Add a `set rotation  style`{:class="block3motion"} block and select the drop-down `don't rotate`{:class="block3motion"} to stop your sprite rotating, even when it bounces.

**Tip:** You can drag your sprite around the Stage to move it to the x (left-right) position that you want.

This code makes a sprite appear to rotate randomly when the green flag is clicked:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (45)
set rotation style [all around v]
forever
move (5) steps
if on edge, bounce
```

If your sprite moves at `45` degrees, you will find it appears to bounces off the edge of the stage in a random direction. Change the number of degrees in the `point in direction`{:class="block3motion"} block to `45` to make a sprite bounce all around.

Add a `set rotation  style`{:class="block3motion"} block and select the drop-down `all around`{:class="block3motion"} so your sprite will turn when it bounces off the edge of the Stage.

This code makes a sprite spin when it is clicked:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
turn right (1) degrees :: motion
```

Change the degrees by which your sprite turns to `1` within a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop and your sprite will appear to spin.

**Tip:** If you don't add a `move`{:class="block3control"} block your sprite will spin in the position its in.

This code makes a sprite fly in a circle when it is clicked:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
move (1) steps
turn right (1) degrees :: motion
```

Change the degrees by which your sprite `moves`{:class="block3control"} to `1` and `turns`{:class="block3control"} to `1` within a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop and your sprite will appear to move in a big cirle.

**Tip**: If you want your sprite to always start in the centre of the Stage, you can add `go to x:(0) y: (0)`{:class="block3motion"} before the `forever`{:class="block3control"}.

Remember to keep running your project to test it. Is the program working as you had planned?

It might take a few experiments to get suitable behaviour for your sprite.

You could try:
+ Dragging your sprite to a different starting location on the Stage.
+ Increasing the number of steps in `move ( ) steps`{:class="block3motion"} to make your sprite move faster or decreasing it to move slower.
+ Changing the number of degrees in `point in direction ( )`{:class="block3motion"} to change the direction that your sprites starts moving in. 
+ Changing the number of degrees in `turn right`{:class="block3motion"} or `turn left`{:class="block3motion"} so that your sprite turns faster or slower. 
+ Combining `move ( ) steps`{:class="block3motion"} and `turn right`{:class="block3motion"} or `turn left`{:class="block3motion"} blocks so that your sprite moves and turns. 
+ Experimenting with `set rotation style [ ]`{:class="block3motion"} to make sure you understand what the different options do

**Tip:** It's easier to identify issues if you make one change at a time and then run your program.
