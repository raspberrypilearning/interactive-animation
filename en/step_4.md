## Choose your theme

Now it's time to start working on your own project. You may be bursting with ideas already, or you may need to take a few minutes to decide on a theme you want to work with.

Open a [new Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor){:target=”_blank”}, to look at the range of sprites and backgrounds, and take 5 minutes to think about **your** Make a difference project. 

+ What mood do you want to create? Relaxing, Energising, Funny?
+ Which backdrop will you choose? 
+ Which sprites will you choose? 
+ Maybe you will just start with one sprite and add more if you have time.
