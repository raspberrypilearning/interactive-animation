How did your '**Interactive animation**' project go? Is there anything you would do like to improve? 

Remind yourself what you have achieved:

--- task ---
I planned what I wanted a sprite to do and then used Scratch blocks to make it happen
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used a **How to ...** to find out which code blocks to use to do what I wanted
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I clicked on **See inside** to view the code for a project
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used an `if on edge, bounce`{:class="block3motion"} block inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop to make my sprite turn away from the edge of the Stage
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop to animate my sprite
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I modified a costume in the Paint editor
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used `graphic effect`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to change how my sprite appeared
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used the `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} block to create user interaction
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I used `size`{:class="block3looks"} or `layer`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to make the animation appear three-dimensional
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I tested my project and then made an improvement 
--- /task ---
